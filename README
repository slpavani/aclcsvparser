Question
Please write a simple C# application which will read a CSV (delimited) and convert to our data file structure.

How it works?

It takes the CSV file as an input, which is in the format specified in the question. It writes the output to flat file(txt) in the given format.

Throws Invalid File format exception incase the file is not the specified format.
For example if the number of columns in a single row is > 6

Usecases:
Validations are added  for the columns - SIN, Salary. 
Validations for column type and column length is considered.
While writing data to flat file space between columns is not considered.
A row is skipped incase no.of columns in a row is < 6
Logging the skipped rows and exceptions to a log file.
Unittests are added considering different edge cases.

Note: Appending data to output file and logfile if file already exists in the specfied root directory(c:\temp).
